  - Articles written
  - Courses purchased
  - Courses completed

In a sense, this is a public accountability document for myself, which is based on
many of the performant Twitter accounts that I follow. Collectively, they state this one Truth:

"Consistency matters: turn up every day and persist."

Or in other words, "Say what you mean, do what you say."
