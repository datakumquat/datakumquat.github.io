Just before the New Year broke, I posted that I had wanted to commit to a course of regular Creation in both Tweets and longform Articles.

The impetus for this was from [The Creators], who all state the key to success on Twitter, in Business or anywhere else is Consistency, with a Capital 'C'.

That is one of the key advantages of [Building in Public], if you say you are going to do something on Twitter, then in the interests of your accountability and more importantly credibility, you had better do it.

**Stated Goals:**

  - Tweet 3-5 times per day
  - Comment upto 5 times per day
  - Create and publish a new article every day
  - Study each day
  - In addition to the rest of my Life

**Anecdotal Results:**

  - Tweets: Most days, 2-4
  - Comments: Most days, 1-3
  - Articles: Have dropped 9 days
  - Study: 100%
  - Overall: Underperforming

I will take some time this week to do a comparison Table, probably using Jupyter Notebook and paste the result as another longform article, and likely convert that into a .PDF also.

It will get good practice to use Python & Quant techniques for something real, as is strongly recommended by [PyQuantNews].

Best get busy.
