On the weekend while doomscrolling news, I discovered the [Waitlist for professional ChatGPT access] which is hosted using a Google Form.

So I learned three great pieces of information:

  - There will be a supported version of ChatGPT operating as a User-Pays SaaS
  - It's name so far, is Professional ChatGPT
  - OpenAI actually want to hear from the market

As a big fan of ChatGPT and publically-available LLMs anyway, I thought that I would sign up.

**Question 01:**

  - Email_Address
  - Country_of_Residence

**Question_02:**

  - Please describe the most valuable thing you use it for
  - At what price (per month) would you consider ChatGPT to be so expensive that you would not consider buying it?

See below image:

**Question_03:**

  - At what price (per month) would you consider ChatGPT to be priced so low that you would feel the quality couldn’t be very good?
  - At what price (per month) would you consider ChatGPT starting to get expensive, so that it is not out of the question, but you would have to give some thought to buying it?

**Question_04:**

  - At what price (per month) would you consider ChatGPT to be a bargain—a great buy for the money?
  - Reach out to me when paid access becomes available

**Question_05:**

  - How upset would you be if you could no longer use ChatGPT?

Obviously I am very interested in access to ChatGPT, from both the personal Use/Learning and commercial perspectives, so assessing this on a prelimiary basis:

  - I would prefer to pay USD $62.50 per week for reliable access with greater input limits.
  - I would be willing to pay upto USD $100 per week for reliable access with greater input limits.

Just a minor gripe on the last question: "How upset would you be if you could no longer use ChatGPT?"

Sorry, but I have to ask, what are we? 5? I would not be upset, I'd be technically limited or briefly disappointed but I would rapidly adjust and seek another path.

That's what Humans do.

Adapt or die.
