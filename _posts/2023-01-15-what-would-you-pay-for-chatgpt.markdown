On the weekend while doomscrolling news, I discovered the [Waitlist for professional ChatGPT access] which is hosted using a Google Form.

So I learned three great pieces of information:

  - There will be a supported version of ChatGPT operating as a SaaS
  - It's name so far, is Professional ChatGPT
  - OpenAI actually want to hear from the market

As a big fan of ChatGPT and publically-available LLMs anyway, I thought that I would sign up.

**Question 01:**

  - Email_Address
  - Country_of_Residence

**Question_02:**

  - How do you use ChatGPT?
  - Please describe the most valuable thing you use it for
