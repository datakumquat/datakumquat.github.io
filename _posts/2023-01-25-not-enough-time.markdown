Thinking about Time, after reading people 'hack time', in both longform articles or social media.

So, what do I/You nominally have?

**24 hours in a Day:**

  - 8 Hours theoretical Sleep (Usually less)
  - 8 Hours theoretical Work (Usually more)
  - 1 Hour Food Time
  - 1 Hour Leisure Time
  - 0.75 Hour Hygiene Time
  - 2 Hour Family Time
  - 3.25 Hour Remaining Time

Funny though, it always seems that I do not have enough Time.

Ever.

Why is that?

I am going to out myself and say, "Inefficiency." Without a doubt.

When you have so many 'things to do' but you work without a plan, in the end nothing really gets done.

'Work' is easy because we have to work, usually to someone else's timetable, with defined tasks and time restrictions. That is the price you pay to be employed; not only do you trade your Time for their Money, but you trade your When for their Need.

But, everything else is some sort of personal, laissez-faire approach to Life.

Sleep? Well as long as it is sometime during the Night, not too far past Midnight (Ha, if only) and up at about 1 hour before I have to start Work.

Food? Eat when I am hungry or I get reminded I should.

Shower? Well that's once per day but more a chore than an experience to feel fresh from.

And the rest of it? When the Dog is fed; the car is locked; dishwasher is empty etc etc etc.

Looking at that, yep I am not 'hacking time', if anything I am wasting it. If not wasting it, I am allowing it to slip away day-by-day, year-by-year and the only comfort that I can take, is that I am not alone.

Very few of us have 'hacking time' sorted, we do the best we can.

However the really sad thing is? Generally we have far less Time than we think.

That both frightens and emboldens me.

Time to go head-to-head with Time.
