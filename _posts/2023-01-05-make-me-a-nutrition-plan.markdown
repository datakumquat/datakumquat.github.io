I mentioned early today in this [Tweet] that I was writing the largest Text Prompt that I have ever created to get ChatGPT via XP1 to create me a custom nutrition plan.

Well, this was great fun, and very enlightening.

Let's jump right in and make a nutrition plan, that adheres to a few key limits and other relevant guidelines. Although there are no direct financial costs involved.

I might find a way to do that in the next few days.

**Query_03:**

> Let's play a role-playing game. I will act as a potential client who is concerned about their overall health and potential life span, and you will act as a highly-experienced Personal Trainer who is also a certified Nutritionist and Sports Physiotherapist. I want you to design me a personal nutrition plan, that will allow me to intake a maximum of 2000 calories per day, contains no more than 0.95 grams of Protein per Kilogram of Mass, does not contain any Meat except for Chicken or Fish, has very low amounts of Dairy products and is mainly based around Vegetarian meals most likely found in Australia, New Zealand or the Unitied Kingdom. My current mass this morning was 95 Kilograms, I am an adult male, in my early 50s, of a solid build with no known family health risks relating to Heart disease, nor Kidney disease and I do not smoke tobacco products nor drink Alcohol. Make sure that the nutrition plan includes the intake of between 2 and 2.5 litres of fresh water per day, and does not contain any sugary drinks or fast foods. Produce the result with the following headings; Breakfast, mid-Morning Snack, Lunch, mid-Afternoon snack and Dinner, using Metric measurements only. Also, when the plan is complete, provide a summary that highlights the major macronutrients groups and the related daily intake, in a bullet point format.

## Personal Nutrition Plan

### Breakfast
- 1/2 cup of Oats
- 2 tablespoons of Chia Seeds
- 2 tablespoons of Hemp Seeds
- 2 tablespoons of Coconut Flakes
- 1/2 Apple
- 1/4 cup of Dried Cranberries

### Mid-Morning Snack
- 2 tablespoons of Natural Peanut Butter
- 2-3 whole Wheat Crackers

### Mid-Afternoon Snack

- 1/2 cup of Blueberries

### Dinner
- 2 ounces of Salmon

## Macronutrients Summary
- Protein: 85 grams
- Carbs: 340 grams
- Fat: 68 grams
- Water: 2-2.5 litres
- Calories: 2000
{% endhighlight %}

That is a pretty good result, one that would have taken 1 or 2 hours to put together, or 3 minutes if I searched for and located a professional nutrition plan source, and copied, I mean stole it.

Another bonus is that this only cost **USD $0.02.**

2 cents for a custom nutrition plan, that on face value looks pretty healthy if not ahhhh ... exciting.

Let's push the AI a bit harder and introduce some variables and rules that are inline with many people's personal desires; environmental impact and human rights-related.

**Query_Four:**

> Let's play a role-playing game. I will act as a potential client who is concerned about their overall health and potential life span, and you will act as a highly-experienced Personal Trainer who is also a certified Nutritionist and Sports Physiotherapist. I want you to design me a personal nutrition plan, that will allow me to intake a maximum of 2000 calories per day, contains no more than 0.95 grams of Protein per Kilogram of Mass, does not contain any Meat except for Chicken or Fish, has very low amounts of Dairy products and is mainly based around Vegetarian meals most likely found in Australia, New Zealand or the Unitied Kingdom. My current mass this morning was 95 Kilograms, I am an active adult male, in my early 50s, of a solid build with no known family health risks relating to Heart disease, nor Kidney disease and I do not smoke tobacco products nor drink Alcohol. I am also a clinically diagnosed Celiac and cannot eat any Gluten. Make sure that the nutrition plan includes the intake of between 2 and 2.5 litres of fresh water per day, and does not contain any sugary drinks or fast foods. As a concerned citizen, I care about the environment, and do not want to eat any food that has high food-miles, and would prefer to eat only seasonal foods from the Southern Hemisphere, in order of New Zealand products first, followed by Australian products, then followed by Malaysian products and then you can choose whatever you assess as the best. Also when selecting the food, exclude any from any country that is currently the subject of any export control or trade embargo of the United States of America. Finally, produce the result with the following headings; Breakfast, mid-Morning snack, Lunch, mid-Afternoon snack and Dinner, using Metric measurements only. Also, when the plan is complete, provide a summary that highlights the major macronutrients groups and the related daily intake, in a bullet point format.

Well, that was a complete shock, not even a poor result but merely, a non-result.

I want a refund! Although it did also cost **USD $0.02** so that's tolerable.

I posit that it was one of the two 'ethical' considerations that caused an issue. Personally I thought that the trade embargo would have been handled easily. However let's confirm if that is the case.

Almost the same again! So if it encounters any limit on it's knowledge, it's default method is to not return anything but known/fixed information ... like headings. Well at least it mentioned the trade embargo issue, so not a total loss.

Incidentally, this failure was worth another 2 cents 8-)

OK, I am going to play it safe, make some minor changes, and get my nutrition plan!

{% endhighlight %}

That result is pretty close to the first nutrition plan but with a far better summary, in that it is explicit and informative which as a potential customer is exactly what you would want to see.

Overall that was a good use of 1 hour, and *checks notes* ... 10 cents. I cannot believe that for 10 cents I have been able to ask a digital oracle to create this nutrition plan for me, with non fear or favour.

**What did I learn?**

That the ChatGPT is not an all-seeing, infalliable Oracle with a capital O, and that what I thought it could handle, even badly, it did not. Referring of course to the environmental impact and trade embargo requests. Even if it failed, I would have still expected it to generate some sort of plan, not headings only.

Although I did specify clearly that I was a clinically diagnosed Celiac (Which I am not), it provided obvious non-Gluten items, and made no mention if it had sourced any of the other items from certified Gluten-free sources.

However for all intents and purposes it has delivered what I asked for, at a very low cost in both Time and Money, in a style that appeals to me, and I am confident that this plan if nutritionally appraised against my requirements by a professional, it would be 'healthy.'

**Verdict?**

What. An. Awesome. Tool.

I am hooked 100%.
