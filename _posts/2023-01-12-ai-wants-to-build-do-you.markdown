This post is just a quick display of how similar prompts can produce different results.

For this session you will see the results of using the XP1 SaaS, which is a great browser extension for Google Chrome and derived browsers, such as Brave Browser and Opera.

**XP1Q1:**

> Create a plan to guide me through the entire year of 2023, and the plan is to feature 5 sets of goals; Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly and Annual. Present the plan in the form of a list, using bullet points. Ensure that each of the sets of goals is represented by a heading using 3 hash symbols.

**XP1R1:**

Time matters, so have a basic framework with some merit in 15 seconds is far more practical than you would expect.
