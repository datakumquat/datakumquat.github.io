I was watching a Youtube video by [Anthony Vicino] this morning that mentioned the book [Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion], by [Robert B. Cialdini, PhD].

This book was first published in 1984, but has been updated and expanded since then with a seventh lever: Unity, added in the 2000s.

Previously when I direct the OpenAI ChatGPT to review a book, I am quite explicit, perhaps too much.

**A theoretical example:**

{% highlight ruby %}
Referring to the Wikipedia entry for "This Book Title", create a summary of this book, that complies with the following requirements:

* Provide between 6 and 10 points on each core topic
* If unable to provide 6-10 points, ensure maximal impact
* Use business appropriate language
* Provide external references for each of core subjects with fully-qualified and working hyperlinks
* Present the results using Markdown, with H2 headings and bullet point lists
* Limit the result to not more than 500 words, but preferably about 300 words, +/- 50 words
* Do not be repetitive

Clarity > quantity
{% endhighlight %}

Today, I was thinking that is a lot of work, let's shortcut the process and see what happens.

**Query_01:**

{% highlight ruby %}
Summarize the book "Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"
{% endhighlight %}

**Result_01:**

> Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion" is a book written by Robert Cialdini that explores the psychology behind why people say "yes" to things. The book is based on the author's years of research and experience in the field of social psychology.

> Cialdini identifies six key principles of influence that are commonly used by persuaders:
* Reciprocity
* Commitment and consistency
* Social proof
* Liking
* Authority
* Scarcity

> He provides examples and case studies to illustrate how these principles can be used to influence people's behavior in various situations, such as in sales, advertising, and politics.

> The book also discusses the psychology of compliance and how people are more likely to comply with requests when they feel a sense of obligation or commitment to the requester. Cialdini also explores the concept of "click-whirr" automatic responses to stimuli and how these can be used to influence people's behavior.

> Overall, "Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion" provides valuable insights into the psychology of persuasion and the ways in which people can be influenced to say "yes" to requests. It is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the science of persuasion and improve their ability to influence others.

I am surprised with the result, but then after thinking, not really surprised. The ChatGTP ver. 2/3 models have been trained on millions, nay billions of points of Data, what we ordinary people would call 'facts'.

ChatGPT is good at reviewing text, easily identifying semantic and conceptual links, then outputting into a human-friendly format. I cannot wait to see the increased depth of the ChatGPT knowledge domain when ChatGPT ver. 4 will allegedly be trained on trillions of data points.

Trillions! The mind boggles.

Let's regenerate with some specific instructions.

**Query_02:**

{% highlight ruby %}
Using the above result, regenerate and expand on this list of the six core subjects of:

* reciprocity
* commitment and consistency
* social proof
* liking
* authority
* scarcity

Ensure that the results comply with the following requirements:

* Provide between 6 and 10 points on each subject
* If unable to provide 6-10 points, ensure maximal impact
* Use business appropriate language
* Provide external references for each of 6 core subjects with fully-qualified and working hyperlinks
* Present the results using Markdown, with H2 headings and bullet point lists
* Limit the result to not more than 600 words, but preferably about 450 words, +/- 50 words
* Do not be repetitive

Clarity > quantity

The Six Core Principles of Influence.

> In his book "Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion," Robert Cialdini identifies six core principles of influence that can be used to persuade people to say "yes" to a request. These six principles are:

#### Reciprocity

> Reciprocity is the principle that people feel obligated to give back to others who have given to them. When someone does us a favor, we feel compelled to return the favor. Here are some examples of how this principle can be applied in business:
* Offering a free trial of a product or service to potential customers
* Providing a free resource, such as an ebook or white paper, in exchange for contact information
* Providing free samples of a product to potential customers

Reference: [Reciprocity Principle]

#### Commitment and Consistency

> The principle of commitment and consistency suggests that people are more likely to comply with a request if they have already committed to something related to that request. This principle can be applied in the following ways:
* Asking people to commit to small requests before making a larger request
* Emphasizing the consistency between a person's actions and their beliefs or values
* Encouraging people to make public commitments to their goals or beliefs

Reference: [Commitment and Consistency Principle]

#### Social Proof

> Social proof is the principle that people are more likely to do something if they see that others are doing it as well. This principle can be applied in the following ways:
* Using testimonials from satisfied customers to promote a product or service
* Showing the number of customers who have purchased a product or service
* Using social media to show how many people have engaged with a brand or product

Reference: [Social Proof Principle]

#### Liking

> The principle of liking suggests that people are more likely to comply with a request from someone they like or find attractive. This principle can be applied in the following ways:
* Building relationships with potential customers by engaging with them on social media or in person
* Using attractive spokespeople or models in advertising campaigns
* Making small talk and finding common ground with potential customers

Reference: [Liking Principle]

#### Authority

> The principle of authority suggests that people are more likely to comply with a request from someone who is seen as an authority figure. This principle can be applied in the following ways:
* Using endorsements or testimonials from experts in a particular field
* Emphasizing the credentials or experience of the people behind a product or service
* Using uniforms or other symbols of authority in advertising or marketing materials

Reference: [Authority Principle]

#### Scarcity

> The principle of scarcity suggests that people are more likely to want something if they think it is rare or in short supply. This principle can be applied in the following ways:
* Using limited-time offers or discounts to encourage people to make a purchase
* Emphasizing the limited availability of a product or service
* Creating a sense of urgency by using language that suggests that time is running out

Reference: [Scarcity Principle]

> By understanding and applying these six core principles of influence, businesses can increase their ability to persuade customers to say "yes" to their requests. While each principle can be effective on its own, they are even more powerful when combined. When businesses are able to effectively leverage these principles, they can create a compelling case for customers to take action.

Here are a few additional points to consider for each of the six principles of influence:

#### Reciprocity:
* Providing value first can make people more likely to reciprocate by purchasing a product or service.
* Making the first move can be a powerful way to start the reciprocity process.
* The principle of reciprocity can also be used in negotiation, where making a concession can lead to a concession in return.

#### Commitment and Consistency:
* People are more likely to follow through on a request if it is consistent with their values or beliefs.
* Small commitments can be an effective way to build momentum towards larger commitments.
* Using written commitments, such as signing a contract, can be an effective way to reinforce the commitment principle.

#### Social Proof:
* Social proof can be particularly effective in situations where people are uncertain about what action to take.
* Social proof can be even more effective if the people providing the proof are similar to the person being influenced.
* Social proof can also be used to encourage people to take actions that they might not otherwise consider, such as donating to a charity.

#### Liking:
* Building rapport and finding common ground can be an effective way to establish a sense of liking with potential customers.
* Shared experiences and interests can help to build a sense of liking and trust.
* Similarities between the influencer and the influenced can also be an effective way to build liking.

#### Authority:
* The principle of authority can be particularly effective when people are uncertain about what action to take.
* Building credibility and expertise can help establish an authority figure.
* Symbols of authority, such as uniforms or titles, can be an effective way to establish authority.

#### Scarcity:
* Scarcity can create a sense of urgency that encourages people to take action.
* Emphasizing the unique features or benefits of a product can create a sense of scarcity.
* Scarcity can also be used to create a sense of exclusivity or luxury around a product.

By applying these principles of influence in a thoughtful and strategic way, businesses can improve their ability to persuade customers and achieve their goals.

Verdict?

That was not a bad little exercise, starting with a simple prompt, then expanding into a more explicit one, base don the initially returned results and the thoughts that arise form reading that.

I will do some more testing but I think this might be a good method to follow for the future.

**Revised Prompt Query:**
* Simple request
* Review result
* Requery with slightly modified prompt
* Review result
* Requery with specific and focus prompt
* Review result
* Regenerate with attention to grammar, content and readability

Seems as good a process as any.

If you can achieve a MVP with an initial, small effort, why wouldn't you?
