### I broke it!

I didn't really, the 2.5" HDD was making some odd noises during the week, and today it stopped.

Fortunately I always keep a spare 2.5" HDD in the house, with 4 Laptops, it is good practice.

My only gripe, I may have lost the Blog Posts from 16/01/2023-20/01/2023.

Currently I am running through the post-install process, documenting the minimum package installs that I need to get the system functional again.

  - Complete reinstall Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (ZKS; Encrypted Disk)
  - System upgrade
  - cURL
  - Terminator Terminal Emulator
  - New SSH_Key (ed25519)
  - Upload new SSH_Key to GitHub account
  - Set global GitHub configs
  - Brave Browser
  - Python3 Package Manager (Pip)
  - Full Ruby installation
  - RubyGems install
  - Recover Daily_Backups from Home_Server (Sys_Configs, key Scripts)
  - Create 4 x Local_Repositories from 4 x Remote_Repositories
  - Jekyll Static Site Rubygem dependencies (Multiple)
  - Confirm Jekyll site runs and loads
  - My favourite SciFi wallpapers

Then log back into [PyQuant Podia Course] and work through the complete Pip package list again.

Now might also be a good time to fully automate two backups solutions:
  - Bash-driven daily backups to Home_Server
  - Python-driven daily backups using Google Drive

Over the years, I have done a lot of reinstalls, as rarely do I archive my Home_Dir offsite and restore that when things go sideways. As it is usually a personal machine that has failed, I have no issue wiping it all and I have probably developed some bad, data-protection habits.

Still, it is good practice and I am confident doing this in-person or remotely.

A handy skill in a Cloud optimised GAN.
